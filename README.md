# My Portfolio

A personal portfolio showcasing my work as a front-end developer. Built with Next.js, Tailwind, and TypeScript. I chose Next.js for its powerful server-side rendering capabilities, which improve SEO, and its flexibility for future updates, such as adding multiple pages. Explore my projects and feel free to get in touch!
